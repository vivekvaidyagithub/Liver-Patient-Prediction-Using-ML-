    "2. Gender : Gender of the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. TotalBilirubin : Bilirubin is made during the normal process of breaking down red blood cells. It is a yellowish substance found in bile, a fluid in your liver. This fluid helps digest food. A healthy liver moves most of the bilirubin from your body.Normal range for total Bilirubin is  0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DirectBilirubin : Normal range of Direct Bilirubin is less than 0.3 mg/dL (less than 5.1 µmol/L).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Alkaline_Phosphotase : ALP is an enzyme found in your bloodstream. It helps break down proteins in the body and exists in different forms, depending on where it originates. Your liver is one of the main sources of ALP, but some is also made in your bones, intestines, pancreas, and kidneys. In pregnant people, ALP is made in the placenta.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Alamine_Aminotransferase : The function of ALT is to convert alanine into pyruvate, for cellular energy production. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found mostly in liver cells. Apart from the liver, it is also found in heart and muscle cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Aspartate_Aminotransferase : Aspartate aminotransferase is a part of the malate-aspartate shuttle in the myocardium, is involved in gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, glyceroneogenesis in the adipose tissue, and synthesis of neurotransmitters and neuro-glial pathway in the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. TotalProtiens : Proteins are important building blocks of all cells and tissues; they are important for body growth, development, and health. They form the structural part of most organs and make up enzymes and hormones that regulate body functions. Two classes of proteins are found in the blood, albumin and globulin.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Albumin : Albumin is a protein made by your liver. Albumin enters your bloodstream and helps keep fluid from leaking out of your blood vessels into other tissues. It is also carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes throughout your body.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. AlbuminandGlobulinRatio : Albumin, which helps keep blood from leaking out of blood vessels. It also helps move hormones, medicines, vitamins, and other important substances throughout the body. Albumin is made in the liver. Globulins, which help fight infection and move nutrients throughout the body. An imbalance in the ratio of albumin to globulin may signify ongoing inflammation, liver problems, or in rare cases immunodeficiency.\n",
